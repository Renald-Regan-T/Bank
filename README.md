### âœ… **Project Title:** Banking Management System with File Persistence

---

### âœ… **Overview:**

This Java-based project simulates a **banking system** that allows users to:

* Create accounts
* Withdraw money
* Deposit money
* Transfer funds
* View transaction history
* And persist all data (customers and transactions) to files.

---

### âœ… **Features:**

1. **Customer Account Creation**
2. **ATM Withdrawal**
3. **Cash Deposit**
4. **Account-to-Account Transfer**
5. **Transaction History**
6. **Persistent File Storage for Customers and Transactions**

---

### âœ… **Technologies Used:**

* Java Collections (Map, List)
* File I/O using `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter`
* Console-based user interaction

### âœ… **Class Responsibilities:**

#### ðŸ”· `Main`

* Console interface for interacting with the user.
* Routes user input to respective application methods.

#### ðŸ”· `Application`

* Core logic of the banking system.
* Manages all customers and their transactions.
* Handles account operations (add, withdraw, deposit, transfer).
* Manages encryption, authentication, and file persistence.

#### ðŸ”· `Customer`

* Represents a single customer.
* Contains account number, name, balance, encrypted password.
* Holds personal transaction history.

#### ðŸ”· `Transaction`

* Represents a single banking transaction.
* Stores account number, transaction type (deposit/withdrawal/transfer), amount, and balance after transaction.

#### ðŸ”· `File_handling`

* Utility class for reading from and writing to files.
* Maintains persistent data for:

  * Users (`users.txt`)
  * Transactions (`transaction.txt`)

---

### âœ… **Data Flow Example:**

1. **User Chooses: Add Customer**

   * `Application.add_Customer()` is called.
   * Password is encrypted.
   * New Customer is added to `Map`.
   * Opening transaction is created.
   * Customer and transaction info are written to files.

2. **User Chooses: ATM Withdrawal**

   * Authentication is verified.
   * If balance is sufficient, amount is debited.
   * New withdrawal `Transaction` is created and stored.

3. **File Persistence**

   * On exit or command, all customers and transactions are written to files.
   * Can be reloaded anytime using `file_list()`.

---

### âœ… **Password Encryption Logic:**

Simple encryption:
Each character is incremented by 1 (e.g., `a â†’ b`, `9 â†’ 0`, `Z â†’ A`)

Example:

```java
"Banking" â†’ "Cboljoh"
```
